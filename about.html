          Goran Neshich, Ph.D., is the leader of the Computational Biology
          Research Group (CBRG) at the Brazilian Agricultural Research
          Corporation (EMBRAPA), National Agricultural Information Technology
          Research Center (CNPTIA), Campinas - SP, Brazil. Neshich started his
          work in structural bioinformatics while studying structure and
          function relationship of the photosynthetic reaction center during his
          graduate work done with Don DeVault at the University of Illinois at
          Urbana-Champaign (1983-1988). He conducted his postdoctoral research
          with Barry Honig at Columbia University (1997-1998). Neshich is the
          principal author of STING suite of programs (with the current version
          being BlueStarSTING), and STING_DB. STING is a popular database and
          visualization tool providing the largest collection of physicochemical
          parameters that describe protein structure, stability, function, and
          interaction with other macromolecules. STING received approximately 17
          million accesses since 1998. Neshich has published 56 papers in
          indexed scientific journals and 125 abstracts at the meetings and
          congresses. He co-authored 4 patents and conceptualized 51 software
          packages and is the author of the First databank from Latin America
          which made it to the compendium of the Nucleic Acid Research -
          Database Issue: the STING_DB. He gave more than 100 seminars and talks
          at the congresses and research institutions at 16 countries from 5
          continents. He was co-adviser for 19 Ph.D. theses, 6 Master's degree
          theses and 6 scientific initiation works as well as for 3 postdocs in
          the area of Computational Biology. Currently, Neshich is advising and
          co-advising theses work of two students: two (2) Ph.D. From 1990
          through 2018 he coordinated 24 research projects and co-participated
          in other 3 projects, with financial input under his coordination of
          approximately US$1.7 Million (what makes an average of 16,700 USD per
          major published item - not counting abstracts, posters, internal
          tecnical publications nor published seminars). Neshich's latest
          initiative is further developing the STING RDB and by using this
          unique resource/tool, advance our understanding of the relationship
          between sequence, structure and function of proteins, and
          consequently, to be able to describe in more details protein-protein
          and protein-substrate interaction. His special interest now is in high
          throughput screening and rational drug and agrochemical design.
          Neshich is focusing his work on completing the catalog of protein
          district NANOENVIRONMENTS, constructive elements of protein structure
          which could be fully described in terms of ensemble of
          physicochemical, geometric and structural parameters. More about his
          research may be found at www.cbi.cnptia.embrapa.br. Neshich chaired a
          session at the meeting in Angra dos Reis - RJ, held in November 2004,
          where the Brazilian Association for Computational Biology and
          Bioinformatics (AB3C) has been inaugurated. He was a member of the
          Board of Directors of the International Society for Computational
          Biology (ISCB) from 2003 to 2005 and the Intelligent Systems in
          Molecular Biology (ISMB) 2006 Conference Chair in Fortaleza, Brazil.
          Neshich served as the member of the Executive Board of EMBnet from
          2012 to 2015 when he resigned. In April of 2012 Neshich organized SÃ£o
          Paulo School of Advanced Sciences: Advanced Topics in Computational
          Biology - Agrochemical and Drug Design (ESPCA_CBADD). Last update:
